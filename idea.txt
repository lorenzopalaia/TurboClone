Idea:
1. Open cone dialog (input + button)
2. Check if clipboard has a github repository URL
3. If yes, put it in the input field
4. If no, wait for user to input a URL
5. Check if the URL is valid
6. If valid, clone the repository in the folder from where the script is run
7. If invalid, show error message
8. Show success message after cloning
9. Close the dialog

Future improvements:
1. Add a progress bar to show the cloning progress
2. Add an option to choose the branch to clone, done by checking the branches in the repository via the API
3. Add a checkbox to choose if the user wants to run "code <repo_name>" after cloning to open the repository in VSCode
